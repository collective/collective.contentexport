Usage
-----

Provides a form ``/@@collective_contentexport_view`` to configure the export. The form is also availabe in the main controlpanel as `Content export`.

The form allows you to:

- Select the export type
- Select the content type to export
- Choose fields from the selected type to be ignored
- Select the format of richtext-fields (html/plaintext)
- Select the format for files and images (url, base64, location within zip-file)

collective.contentexport uses `tablib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tablib>`_ for several export-formats.


Use in code
-----------

You can use the ``collective_contentexport_view`` in code to have more control over the results.

The view ``collective_contentexport_view`` accepts the following parameters:

export_type
    The export-format you want to use. Accepts the following options:

    - xlsx (Excel Spreadsheet (xlsx))
    - xls (Excel Legacy Spreadsheet (xls))
    - yaml (YAML)
    - html (HTML Table)
    - csv (Comma Separated Values File)
    - tsv (Tab Separated Values File)
    - json (JSON Dump)
    - images (Export images as zip)
    - files (Export files as zip)
    - related (Export related files and images as zip)

portal_type
    The content-type you want to export

blob_format
    The format in which blobs (filed/images) should be exported. Accepts the following options:

    - url (URL)
    - base64 (Base64-encoded string)
    - zip_path (Location within the a zip)

richtext_format
    The format in which richtext (html) should be exported. Options:

    - html
    - text/plain

blacklist
    Fields that should be ommited from the export (cannot be combined with whitelist).

whitelist
    Only these fields should be included in the export (cannot be combined with blacklist).

additional
    Additional data to export. A dict with a name (for the heading) as key and a callable method as value to get additional data for the export from the objects.

query
    Catalog-query to filter the exported content.


The following example creates a zip-file with images or files from the field ``primary_picture`` for the type ``some_type``:

..  code-block:: python

    view = api.content.get_view('collective_contentexport_view', portal, request)
    view(export_type='related', portal_type='some_type', whitelist='primary_picture')

You can filter the items that should be exported by passing a catalog-query:

..  code-block:: python

    path = '/'.join(self.context.getPhysicalPath())
    view = api.content.get_view('collective_contentexport_view', portal, request)
    view(export_type='json', portal_type='Document', query={'review_state': 'published', 'path': path})

You can also extend the export.
In the following example the value ``some_fieldname`` is being extracted from the object using the method ``_somehandler``.

..  code-block:: python

    def _somehandler(obj):
        return some_crazy_transform(obj.custom_field)

    additional = {'some_fieldname': _somehandler}
    view = api.content.get_view('collective_contentexport_view', portal, request)
    result = view(export_type='json', portal_type='Document', additional=additional)

You can also override the default methods to modify the default behavior.
In the following example the ``image`` from Images is being extracted using the method ``_get_imagename`` that only dumps the filename of the image:

..  code-block:: python

    def _get_imagename(obj):
        if obj.image:
            return obj.image.filename

    additional = {'image': _get_imagename}
    view = api.content.get_view('collective_contentexport_view', portal, request)
    result = view(export_type='json', portal_type='Image', additional=additional)
